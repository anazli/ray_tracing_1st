# ray_tracing_1st
A third re-implementation of a ray tracer in C++ based on the excelent
introductory book of Peter Shirley, **Ray tracing in one weekend**. Apart from the **Sphere** class, I added a few more classes to trace different geometric shapes like **Cones, Cylinders, Planes and Disks**.
Some of the images:
